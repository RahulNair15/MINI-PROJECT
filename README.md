## Recyclean - Waste Segregation Application 

**Problem Statement:**
- To automate waste segregation using machine learning. 
- It classifies waste as recyclable or non-recyclable (biodegradable) at disposal points, overcoming the inefficiencies of traditional methods. 
- By employing computer vision and advanced algorithms, it achieves real-time identification of waste materials. 
- The main goals are to create precise recognition algorithms, ensure swift processing, and boost recycling rates while minimizing manual labor and environmental impact in waste management.
